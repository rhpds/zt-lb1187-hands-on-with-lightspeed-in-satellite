== Apply advisories from Red Hat Lightspeed for Satellite.

Red Hat Lightspeed Advisor continuously analyzes platforms and applications to predict risk, recommend actions, and track costs so enterprises can better manage hybrid cloud environments.

Advisor analyzes Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems for configuration problems that could degrade performance or render your system less secure. Red Hat Satellite provides access to the Red Hat Lightspeed Advisor service in a connected and disconnected network topology. In this assignment we’ll review how to use Insights advisor in a
disconnected environment to analyze problems and remediate them automatically.

== Review Lightspeed advisor recommendations

Navigate to the `+Recommendations+` menu.

== Optional: Vulnerability service ==

The Vulnerability Service powered by Red Hat Lightspeed is the primary method for tracking security issues involving viewing and triaging CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

The system displays detailed information about CVEs, including the CVE ID, description, publish date, severity, and CVSS score.

We want to provide a security-first experience for CVEs in Satellite, to complement the current errata-first view of CVEs.

You can access the vulnerability service by clicking on the `+Vulnerability+` menu.

.Vulnerability menu

When you click on a CVE, you will be taken to the CVE details page. Here you can see the details of the CVE, including the description, publish date, severity, and CVSS score.
